Technological advancements, from classroom learning to online video conferencing, offer a glimpse of exciting growth and change in the future of the world’s education system. Science and technology are growing in many ways. New technologies drive change in traditional learning, stimulate sector growth, and revolutionise education. From elementary-school teaching to advanced techniques, our world is changing as technology becomes more prevalent. The traditional education system has always struggled to prepare students for the various fields of work. <br><br> The current challenges faced by traditional colleges and universities students mainly due to higher tuition, linguistic boundaries, and course shortages, leave them with no option but to search for alternatives. Online education has clearly become one of the most sought for alternatives for language courses. The impeccable technology that is now available to have high quality A/V communication over distance; and at a price point that makes it a viable option, quite proves to be the fuel for the continuously increasing reputation of online education.<br><br> Backed by a passionate team, LANGUAGE LINKS E-LEARNING, intends to teach Chinese through online video calls. These desktop classes mean face-to-face, focused discussion, with the ability to loop in integrated learning experiences. This kind of setup signals a major advancement in the flexibility of your learning endeavours. There’s nothing like conversing with a native teacher right on your phone and taking notes from someone who’s a linguistic insider. That’s right! Believe it or not, there are students out there who just want to learn a language and while they do, some of them want to learn your native tongue.<br> With the Internet getting better and better, we envision a world of learning with an even more seamless flow of knowledge about the language, and higher quality communication through video conferencing.
